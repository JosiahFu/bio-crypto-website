                        Cryptocurrency is a type of currency that is handled by an online network
                        instead of a government or bank. There is no physical cryptocurrency,
                        instead it is all represented as data online. It can be sent across the
                        internet nearly instantaneously and is not specific to a single country.

                    <p>
                        A blockchain is a sequence of chunks of data, which are called blocks. Each
                        block is signed with a cryptographic hash that is influenced by the previous
                        block, meaning that you can't alter the history of the blockchain otherwise
                        the hashes won't match. Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchains to store their
                        transaction history. Every transaction that is made for any cryptocurrency
                        is recorded on the blockchain, preventing any users from resusing coins.

                    <p>
                        Most popular cryptocurrencies work on a Proof of Work system, where to add a
                        block to the blockchain, someone has to guess numbers for a block until the
                        hash falls below a certain amount. The people, companies, or computers that
                        do this are called miners, and they earn cryptocurrency when they add blocks
                        to the blockchain. Only the first miner to solve the hash receives the award.

                    <p>
                        Because cryptocurrency requires making hundreds to thousands of guesses to
                        find the right hash, it uses a lot of energy. Bitcoin, the most popular
                        cryptocurrency, uses 204.5 terawatt-hours per year, which is comparable to
                        Thailand's annual power consumption.

                        As the vast majority of electricity is still produced by fossil fuels,
                        cryptocurrencies add a significant amount of carbon to the atmosphere.
                        Bitcoin produces 114 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, most of
                        which is produced by coal mining.

                        Computer hardware advances quickly. In cryptocurrency, processing speed
                        usually wins the hash solving, and because of this, mining hardware becomes
                        outdated quickly, and is replaced often. This leads to massive amounts of
                        e-waste polluting the environment.

                        There are also cryptocurrencies that reduce mining or avoid it entirely.

                        <li>Ethereum 2.0 uses a system called Proof of Stake which eliminates the concept of racing to find a hash</li>

                        <li>LiteCoins only take 1/4 of the time to mine as major cryptocurrencies do</li>

                        To reduce the impact of cryptocurrency in the future, there are several problems to
                        solve. It would be extremely difficult to get rid of cryptocurrencies entirely, as
                        it's already widespread and some people have invested a lot of money in it.
                        Transactions also need to remain cryptographically secure, as that's what allows
                        cryptocurrencies to operate without a central authority.  Finally, any solution will
                        need to convince hundreds to thousands of people to switch over, as there is no
                        central authority.

                    <p>
                        Cryptocurrency users need to be made more aware of the environmental effects of
                        cryptocurrency. This can be done through  Environmentally friendly currencies should
                        be encouraged, and existing currencies could be altered to be more environmentally
